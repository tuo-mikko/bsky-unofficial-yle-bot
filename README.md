## Unofficial YLE bot for Bluesky

Despite growing user numbers, the social media platform Bluesky still lacks finnish language media outlets. To remedy this untill they join the platform, I thought it might be interesting to make a bot that does just that.

The idea is to first query the finnish public broadcasting company YLE's webpage for most recent news, save the title and link of a new article, and post them to Bluesky.
